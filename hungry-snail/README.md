# Hungry Snail
Python implementation of the curses game 'Greed'.

## Goal of the Game
You are a hungry snail '@' wanting to eat as many numbers as possible. When you move in a direction, you erase N number of grid squares in that direction, N being the first number in that direction. Don't be too greedy though, because you can't make moves that over the border of the grid or that go over empty squares!

How much of the board can you eat before you find yourself in a dead end?

## Controls
Move with 'WASD'.
